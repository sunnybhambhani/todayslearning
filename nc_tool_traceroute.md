Traceroute is a tool to trace the path of an IP packet as it traverses routers, and it is a great utility for checking the route from a source to a destination. The traceroute command is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to troubleshoot network problems.

PS: Different platforms offer traceroute as a tool, such as TRACERT on Windows or TRACEROUTE on Linux and Mac.

Here are some examples of how to use the traceroute command in Linux:

$ sudo apt install traceroute

To perform a traceroute to a host:
$ traceroute google.com

To perform a traceroute to a host with the IP address:
