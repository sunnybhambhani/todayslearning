This article is about another network troubleshooting utility called `telnet`. It is a network protocol that allows you to connect to remote systems over a TCP/IP network. It is used to connect to servers and network equipment over port 23. Though telnet is not a secure protocol and is not recommended due to the lack of encryption, it really helps in troubleshooting issues.

Telnet is simple to use; simply type `telnet` into the shell and you will be transported to the world of telnet.
