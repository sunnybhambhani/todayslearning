## Kubernetes Deployment Best Practices: Strategies for Ensuring Security and Efficiency ##

In today's world, Kubernetes is being used in almost every organization, and deploying an application in Kubernetes can be a bit daunting if not done properly. 

Nevertheless, by adhering to best practises, you can make sure your deployment is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

Here are some recommendations for optimal practises:

- Kubernetes manifests: Instead of using imperative commands, you should use declative approach. You should specify your application's deployment, services, and other resources using Kubernetes manifests. Manage modifications to these manifests and keep track of their history using version control like git, bitbucket, etc.
- Design for scalability: Instead of scaling vertically by adding additional resources to a single node, design your application to grow horizontally by adding more replicas. To automatically scale your application based on usage, use Kubernetes technologies like horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA).
- Liveness and readiness probes: To assist Kubernetes detect whether your application is operating and prepared to serve traffic, define liveness and readiness probes. By doing this, you can avoid having your application flagged as unhealthy and deleted.
- Namespaces: To keep your application separate from other ones operating in the same cluster, use namespaces. This can increase security and assist avoid naming conflicts.
