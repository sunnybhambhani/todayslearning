# Trivy #

Scanning for vulnerabilities is critical, and there are many tools and utilities available today, of which Trivy is my favorite.

Trivy is a command-line vulnerability scanner utility, not just for containers or Docker images, but it can do a lot. It can help you scan your config files for misconfigurations, scan the filesystem, scan your local and remote repositories, and, most importantly, it can help you scan your K8s cluster (though this is an experimental feature as of this writing).

Just a brief introduction to Trivy, It is designed to quickly and easily identify known vulnerabilities in your platform and can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development process. It is an open-source software and is available for use on a wide range of operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
